## Companies Using GO (Tunahan)

Many famous companies in the world use go language in certain areas like Web Development, Cloud & Network Services, etc. In a few examples:

- American Express uses GO for payment & rewards.
- Paypal taps GO to modernize and scale.
- Riot Games - leveraging Golang for game development and operations.
- Salesforce - from Python/C to GO
- Uber - GPU-power analytics engine in GO.
- Twitch - GO's march to low-latency GC.
- Monzo - Building a bank with Golang, microservices and containers.

## Bitly - Why We Write Everything in GO (Tunahan)

## Where Go came from and where it is now (Hadi)
- The Go was born because google's codebase has been getting more and more complex in time.
- It was designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
- Go was announced to the public in 2009, and it was made open source in 2012 when its first version, 1.0, was released.
- Go language is a statically typed language. Meaning that the variable types are known and verified at compile time. Unlike dynamically typed languages where the variable types are checked at runtime.
- Go quickly rose in popularity and became many developers' first choice due to its simplicity, readability, efficiency, and concurrent nature.
- Go is used for server-side (backend) programming, game development, cloud-based programming, and even Data Science.
- As of December 21st, 2022, Go is one of the Top 10 most poplular programming langagues.


## Why learn Go?(Hadi)
### Go language is small and simple
Go is meant to be simple to learn, straightforward to work with, and easy to read by other developers.
Go is reminiscent of C in its syntax, making it relatively easy for longtime C developers to learn.

### Go is fast

Go performance is as good as C for the vast majority of work, and generally much faster than other languages known for speed of development (e.g., JavaScript, Python, and Ruby).


## Where Go language works best (Hadi)
No language is suited to every job, but some languages are suited to more jobs than others.
Go shines brightest for developing the following application types:
- Cloud-native development
- Distributed network services
- Utilities and stand-alone tools




## Go language limitations (Hadi)
- Go’s opinionated set of features has drawn both praise and criticism. Go is designed small and easy to understand, with certain features deliberately omitted. The result is that some features that are commonplace in other languages simply aren’t available in Go—on purpose.
- Another potential downside to Go is the size of the generated binaries. Go binaries are statically compiled by default, meaning that everything needed at runtime is included in the binary image. This approach simplifies the build and deployment process, but at the cost of a simple “Hello, world!” weighing in at around 1.5MB on 64-bit Windows.

## Naming Conventions for Golang Functions(Ahmet)
- A name must begin with a letter, and can have any number of additional letters and numbers.
- A function name cannot start with a number.
- A function name cannot contain spaces.
- If the functions with names that start with an uppercase letter will be exported to other packages. If the function name starts with a lowercase letter, it won't be   exported to other packages, but you can call this function within the same package.
- If a name consists of multiple words, each word after the first should be capitalized like this: empName, EmpAddress, etc.
- Function names are case-sensitive (car, Car and CAR are three different variables).
